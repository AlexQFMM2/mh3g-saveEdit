# mh3g-saveEdit

Qt 5 save viewer/editor for Monster Hunter 3G / Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate.
The editor automatically detects both supported character-file formats:

- Nintendo 3DS `user1`/`user2`/`user3`: 35,328 bytes (`0x8A00`), little-endian.
- Wii U `user1`/`user2`/`user3`: 35,364 bytes (`0x8A24`), a 36-byte header followed by big-endian character data.

Always keep an untouched backup of the complete save directory before editing.

The Chinese management interface keeps Character, Item Chest, and Equipment Box in one window.
Saving atomically replaces the currently opened file; there is no Save As command and the editor
does not create a backup. A successful save is confirmed by a message box.

## Game-resource ID tables

The item, five armor-part, and twelve weapon CSV tables are generated from the
zero-based GMD arrays in the audited MH3G `ID_res.arc`; Dex database keys and
filtered third-party row numbers are not treated as save IDs. The full arrays
include all `DUMMY` and unused slots so later names can never shift when a
placeholder is hidden in the UI.

The authoritative counts are 1,533 item slots; 380 head, 382 chest, 363 arms,
371 waist, and 377 legs slots; plus the complete 12 weapon arrays. The rebuild
restores 7 valid collaboration weapons, 9 valid collaboration items, and the
late collaboration armor entries omitted by the old lists.

See [`data/README.md`](data/README.md) for source hashes, the replacement-font
limitation, deterministic rebuild commands, and validation details.

## 3DS / Wii U item and equipment transfer

The item-chest and equipment-box windows can export all 1,000 slots to versioned CSV transfer forms. Open the destination character file (3DS or Wii U), import the matching form, confirm the listed-slot replacement, and then save the character file from the main window.

The forms contain normalized logical values rather than platform-specific save bytes. This lets the editor recreate items and equipment with the destination platform's correct byte order without attempting an unsafe full-save conversion. Import is validated before any slot is changed; listed slots are overwritten and slots omitted from a form are left unchanged.

## Linux build

Install the Qt 5 development tools, then run:

```bash
qmake MH3USaveEditorGUI.pro
make -j
./run-linux.sh
```

## Windows build

Install a Qt 5 MinGW kit first, then run from the repository root. For MSYS2 MINGW64, the Qt bin path is usually `C:\msys64\mingw64\bin`; MSYS2 may provide the tools as `qmake-qt5.exe` and `windeployqt-qt5.exe`, which this script also supports.

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build-windows.ps1 -QtBin C:\Qt\5.15.2\mingw81_64\bin
```

If the script can find Qt under `C:\Qt`, `-QtBin` can be omitted:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build-windows.ps1
```

The packaged Windows build is written to `release/windows/`. The script runs `windeployqt`, ensures the `platforms/qwindows.dll` plugin is present, and then copies additional MinGW/MSYS2 runtime DLLs detected by `objdump`.

## Save-format regression test

Pass known-good 3DS and Wii U character files to the test runner:

```bash
./tests/run-save-format-tests.sh /path/to/3ds/user1 /path/to/wiiu/user1
```

The test verifies byte-identical unchanged round trips, read/write byte-order conversion for money, Moga Points, items, equipment, and jewels, and item/equipment transfers in both directions. Test inputs are never overwritten.

# mh3g-saveEdit

Qt 5 save viewer/editor for Monster Hunter 3G / Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate.
The editor automatically detects both supported character-file formats:

- Nintendo 3DS `user1`/`user2`/`user3`: 35,328 bytes (`0x8A00`), little-endian.
- Wii U `user1`/`user2`/`user3`: 35,364 bytes (`0x8A24`), a 36-byte header followed by big-endian character data.

Always keep an untouched backup of the complete save directory before editing.

## Linux build

Install the Qt 5 development tools, then run:

```bash
qmake MH3USaveEditorGUI.pro
make -j
./run-linux.sh
```

## Windows build

Install a Qt 5 MinGW kit first, then run from the repository root. For MSYS2 MINGW64, the Qt bin path is usually `C:\msys64\mingw64\bin`; MSYS2 may provide the tools as `qmake-qt5.exe` and `windeployqt-qt5.exe`, which this script also supports.

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build-windows.ps1 -QtBin C:\Qt\5.15.2\mingw81_64\bin
```

If the script can find Qt under `C:\Qt`, `-QtBin` can be omitted:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build-windows.ps1
```

The packaged Windows build is written to `release/windows/`. The script runs `windeployqt`, ensures the `platforms/qwindows.dll` plugin is present, and then copies additional MinGW/MSYS2 runtime DLLs detected by `objdump`.

## Save-format regression test

Pass known-good 3DS and Wii U character files to the test runner:

```bash
./tests/run-save-format-tests.sh /path/to/3ds/user1 /path/to/wiiu/user1
```

The test verifies byte-identical unchanged round trips and read/write byte-order conversion for money, Moga Points, items, equipment, and jewels. Test inputs are never overwritten.
